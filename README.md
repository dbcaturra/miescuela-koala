## :school: What is Koala LMS?

**Koala LMS** is a **Learning Management System** (*LMS*) that aims to be simple, **made by users**, **for users**. It has been originally developed in the [LORIA Laboratory](http://www.loria.fr/fr/), Nancy, France.

Contrary to other LMS like Moodle for instance, **Koala LMS** wants to stay **simple**, **user focused** and without useless functionalities. Features and requirements come from interviews of people from the [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/), Nancy, France.

A demonstration instance is available at [demo.koala-lms.org](https://demo.koala-lms.org). It is populated with sample data and refreshed every ten minutes (ie: 2:20; 2:30, etc.). Login as “Erik Orsenna” to access relevant data with the following credentials: `erik-orsenna` and `koala-lms` as the password. Up to now, the demonstration server is populated with data in french, coming from Wikipedia.

**Koala-LMS** components are free software (free as in freedom). All of them are distributed under the [**GPLv3 Licence**](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html). We want free code to **remain free**! :blush:
